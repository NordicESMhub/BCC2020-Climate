##  How we will operate?

### Registration/Login to Galaxy Climate

- We will be using Galaxy Climate https://usegalaxy.eu/ for this tutorial
- If you have already registered to Galaxy Europe ([https://usegalaxy.eu/](https://usegalaxy.eu/) then you are ready to go
- Otherwise, please register before we start at [https://usegalaxy.eu/login](https://usegalaxy.eu/login).

### Join Climate training group

- Please go to the following URL:

          [https://usegalaxy.eu/join-training/gcc-climate](https://usegalaxy.eu/join-training/gcc-climate)

You will be added to the training group and put into a private queue which should be a bit faster than our regular queue. Our training queue will be available from 2020-07-17 to 2020-07-19.

## Collaborative document

We will be using a collaborative document:
- where participants can introduce themselves
- so that I can follow your progress
- where you can ask questions (always at the bottom of the document) that I or any of you can answer.


---

## Agenda


- Short presentation on the topic
- Presentation of the training material [Getting your hands-on climate data](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/climate/tutorials/climate-101/tutorial.html)
- Introduction of the datasets
- Galaxy tools you can use for the hands-on
- Hands-on exercises: 
    - You work on the provided material, feel free to dicuss within others,
    - Use the collaborative document to indicate when you are done with an exercise,
    - Should you have any problem, please use the *chat*,
    - I have set-up a **get help table** that you can visit whenever you need individual support.
- Discussion and feedback.

## What we mean by "Climate"?

To make sure we all have the same understanding:

*According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate), Climate is defined as the **average state** of everyday’s weather condition **over a period of 30 years**. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.*

## Weather versus climate

Watch [this Video](https://youtu.be/e0vj-0imOLw) to get an illustration of the difference between climate and weather.

## Types of climate data resources

When we talk about climate data, the type of data can vary significantly. We have very little actual observations at the scale of climate and usually not covering a large area.

The type of climate data you will be using greatly depends on the period of time you are interested in:

- Observations
- Re-analyses
- Climate models

*There is a wealth of data and information available about the past, current and future climate.*

**Not all of it is up-to-date and trustworthy**

- Check the provenance and data provider credentials

**Not all the variables/parameters are necessarily relevant for your study**

- Prioritize the use of Essential Climate Variables

**Not all the
