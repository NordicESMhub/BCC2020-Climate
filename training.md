##  How we will operate?

### Registration/Login to Galaxy Climate

- We will be using Galaxy Climate https://usegalaxy.eu/ for this tutorial. 
- If you have already registered to Galaxy Europe ([https://usegalaxy.eu/](https://usegalaxy.eu/) then you are ready to go
- Otherwise, please register before we start at [https://usegalaxy.eu/login](https://usegalaxy.eu/login)

### Join Climate training group

- Please go to the following URL:
[https://usegalaxy.eu/join-training/gcc-climate](https://usegalaxy.eu/join-training/gcc-climate)

You will be added to the training group and put into a private queue which should be a bit faster than our regular queue. Our training queue will be available from 2020-07-17 to 2020-07-19. 

### Collaborative document

We will be using a collaborative document:
- where participants can introduce themselves
- so that I can follow your progress
- where you can ask questions (always at the bottom of the document) that I or any of you can answer
